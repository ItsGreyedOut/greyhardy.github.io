                    <p>Science based pharmaceutical company named Pymaceuticals Inc. out of San Diego, CA.
                      Pymaceuticals
                      specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for
                      potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin
                      cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug
                      regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose
                      of
                      this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus
                      the other treatment regimens. All tables and figures needed for the techical study provided.</p>

                      median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
                      Generate
                      a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of
                      total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study. Generate a pie plot
                      using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of
                      female
                      or male mice in the study.Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most
                      promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the
                      quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all
                      four
                      treatment regimens. Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume
                      for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing
                      their
                      color and style. Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of
                      tumor
                      volume vs. time point for that mouse. Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average
                      tumor
                      volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear
                      regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot
                      the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot. Look across all previously
                      generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be

                      accomplish this, I use a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a
                      little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities. To assist

                    <p>Description: In 2017 an entrepreneur wanted to open a brewery in the United States, USA. She
                      needed to determine the top five styles of beer that contains the highest alcohol by volume (ABV)
                      should be produced. A competitive location was identified by finding the top five states with the
                      least number of competitors producing those beers in that state. She analyzed 2,410 US craft beers
                      and 510 US breweries.
                      Business questions to answer:
                      Which style has the highest alcohol by volume (ABV)?
                      What is the most brewed style of beer?
                      Which state(s) has the most selection of beers with highest alcohol by volume (ABV) rating?
                      Which state(s) has the least selection of beers with highest alcohol by volume (ABV) rating?
                      Potential Hypotheses:
                      She assumes the beer with the highest alcohol by volume (ABV) is the most profitable.
                      A state not producing a large amount of high ABV beers would be the ideal location to open her
                      brewery.

                      Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. The CSV data was inspected and an entity-relationship
                      model was sketched out using Quick Database Diagrams. As an engineering
                      you have to create a database from six CSV files. The project will design tables to hold data,
                      import the data from the CSVs into a database, and answer the questions about the data. This
                      project
                      also adds complexity by importing the SQL database into Pandas instead of reading the CSV files

                    <p>Science based pharmaceutical company named Pymaceuticals Inc. out of San Diego, CA.
                      Pymaceuticals
                      specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for
                      potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin
                      cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug
                      regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose
                      of
                      this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus
                      the other treatment regimens. All tables and figures needed for the techical study provided.</p>

                      median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
                      Generate
                      a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of
                      total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study. Generate a pie plot
                      using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of
                      female
                      or male mice in the study.Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most
                      promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the
                      quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all
                      four
                      treatment regimens. Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume
                      for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing
                      their
                      color and style. Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of
                      tumor
                      volume vs. time point for that mouse. Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average
                      tumor
                      volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear
                      regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot
                      the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot. Look across all previously

                    <p>The Mars News Site was craped to collect the latest news title and paragraph text. Splinter was
                      used to pull a featured image from the JPL Mars Space site. Instead of saving an image, the image
                      is imported by an assigned url string to a variable. Next using Pandas we scraped the Mars Facts
                      website table that contained the facts about the planet. Then used Pandas to convert the data to
                      the HTML string. For the Mars Hemispheres, we pulled high resolution images for each of the
                      Mar's hemispheres. Instead of saving image the image url string image was stored using the keys
                      img_url and title in a Python dictionary. MongoDB and Flask templating were used to create the
                      HTML page that displayed all the information that was scraped fom the URLs. The Jupyter notebook
                      was converted into a Python script called scrape_mars.py with a functhion called scrape that will
                      execute all of your scraping code from above and return one Pythone dictionary containing all of
                      the scraped data. Then a route was created to import the script and call the scrape function. The
                      value that was returned was stored in Mongo as a Python dictionary. A root route was created that
                      will query the Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data. A
                      template HTML file was created that took the mars data dictionary and displayed all the data in
                      the appropriate HTML elements. </p>

                      the palate for most of us. Food consumption also depends on the weather in the state.

                      state rainfall information using SQL on state code column. Refer to Merging_Datasets_query.sql in

                    <p>The project researches researches microbes that colonize in human navels. An interactive
                      dashboard was created using the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset reveals that a
                      small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the
                      study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.</p>
                    <p><strong>Steps taken:</strong>The D3 library was used to read in samples.json. Different charts
                      (bar and bubble) were used to
                      display the data. Each key-value from the metadata JSON object was displayed on the page. All of
                      this information was collected and displayed on a dashboard.</p>

                    <p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about
                      natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and
                      land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and
                      useful information about the Earth and its processes.
                    </p>
                    <p>The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their
                      earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they
                      lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will
                      allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure
                      more funding) on issues facing our planet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
                    <p>A dataset was used from USGS using GeoJson Feed and API. A map was created using Leaflet that
                      plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longtitude and latitude. The data
                      markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by
                      color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth
                      should appear darker in color. </p>

                    <p> A+ = "Hi Grey, great job on this assignment! For your map, good work getting the map tile layer
                      to load without error, connecting to the geojson API using D3, and having your markers correspond
                      to earthquake magnitude and depth, although they should correspond to size and color respectively,
                      not the other way around. Good job adding a legend, but I would suggest editing the title to make
                      it clear which measurement it represents, and consider changing the color because the brighter end
                      blends in with the background.

                      All your data points are located correctly, and you have tooltips for each location with
                      information about magnitude, but you did not include depth. Awesome work having a functional
                      control to change between four map styles and add or remove the earthquake data. Really nice work
                      adding a tectonic plate layer and a control for the user to add or remove it. Excellent work
                      overall showcasing your leaflet skills! Keep it up!"

                    <p>About this project: As frequent flyers, our team was interested in exploring in-flight emergency
                      air situations using squawk 7700 codes. We created an interactive web dashboard using Heroku to
                      explore over 4.2 million rows of data from OpenSky which we loaded into PostgreSQL. Data is
                      derived from the OpenSky dataset in order to illustrate in-flight emergency situations triggering
                      the 7700 transponder code. Data spans flights seen by the network's more than 2500 members between
                      1 January 2018 and 29 January 2020. Multiple charts update from data that is stored in PostgreSQL.
                      The project is powered by a Python Flask API and Heroku. Airlines can use this data to highlight
                      safety issues they need to address and compare aircraft performance. Customers can use this data
                      to learn about frequent flight emergencies and select airlines or aircraft types with fewer
                      emergencies.
