                      Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
                      Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many
                      organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for
                      finding success. In this project I organized and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in
                      order to uncover any hidden trends.</p>
                    <p>To accomplish this project I used conditional formating, pivot tables, stacked column pivot
                      charts, countifs() formula, line charts, and provided a statistical analysis. </p>

                      <p>This work showcases Python and adding in a package with lots of new methods and functions that
                        make working with data easier in the long run. Python is a scripting language, while Pandas is a
                        library that works on top of Python and makes data manipulation easier. Libraries are
                        pre-written
                        chunks of code that make it easier to unlock the capabilities of a programming language. Science
                        based pharmaceutical company named Pymaceuticals Inc. out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals
                        specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for
                        potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin
                        cancer.
                      </p>
                      <p>In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug
                        regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose
                        of
                        this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus
                        the other treatment regimens. All tables and figures needed for the techical study provided.</p>
                      <p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
                      <p>Remove any duplicates (mouse ID), generage summary statistics table consisting of the mean,
                        median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
                        Generate
                        a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of
                        total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study. Generate a pie plot
                        using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of
                        female
                        or male mice in the study.Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most
                        promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the
                        quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all
                        four
                        treatment regimens. Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume
                        for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing
                        their
                        color and style. Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of
                        tumor
                        volume vs. time point for that mouse. Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average
                        tumor
                        volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear
                        regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot
                        the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot. Look across all previously
                        generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be
                        made
                        from the data. Observations included at the top of notebook.</p>

                      <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a pre-written set of code that helps you
                        interact with somebody else’s information. Using APIs will give us the ability to
                        programmatically
                        obtain and parse data from sources like OpenWeatherMap, the US Census, and more. In this project
                        I
                        plotted Data Frames from the API data using Matplotlib. This is one of the ways that I was able
                        to
                        source outside data to use for my projects, and its a great opportunity to practice working with
                        external data. When working with APIs - documentation is key! Each API I use has a different set
                        of rules and guidelines and half the fun is learning all the features each one can provide.
                        Using
                        Python request, APIs, and JSON traversal to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather
                        like as we approach the equator?" In this project, I'll be creating a Python script to visualize
                        the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish
                        this, I use a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create
                        a
                        representative model of weather across world cities. To assist in future vacation decisions, a
                        heat map that displays the humidity for every city will be generated using the weather data,
                        jupyter-gmaps, and Google Places API..</p>
                      <p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
                      <p>Create a series of scatter plots with an analysis to showcase the following relationships:
                        Temperature (F) vs.Latitude, Humidity (%) vs. Latitude, Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude, and Wind
                        Speed
                        (mph) vs. Latitude. Next provide linear regresson with analysis on each relationship, only this
                        time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and
                        Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). The final notebook ramdomly selects 500
                        unique
                        (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude. It performs a weather check on each of the
                        cities using a series of successive API calls. Include a print log of each city as it's being
                        processed with the city number and city name. And Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG
                        image
                        for each scatter plot.

                      <p>Description: In 2017 an entrepreneur wanted to open a brewery in the United States, USA. She
                        needed to determine the top five styles of beer that contains the highest alcohol by volume
                        (ABV)
                        should be produced. A competitive location was identified by finding the top five states with
                        the
                        least number of competitors producing those beers in that state. She analyzed 2,410 US craft
                        beers
                        and 510 US breweries. Business questions to answer: Which style has the highest alcohol by
                        volume
                        (ABV)? What is the most brewed style of beer? Which state(s) has the most selection of beers
                        with
                        highest alcohol by volume (ABV) rating? Which state(s) has the least selection of beers with
                        highest alcohol by volume (ABV) rating? Potential Hypotheses: She assumes the beer with the
                        highest alcohol by volume (ABV) is the most profitable. A state not producing a large amount of
                        high ABV beers would be the ideal location to open her brewery.</p>
                      <p><strong>Steps Taken:</strong></p>
                      <p>Using a dataset from Kaggle do an analysis on beer styles and brewery locations. Create
                        visualizations using Python analysis. Create a presentation using PowerPoint and include

                      <p>This project allows me to show the SQL skills I've learned in the GT course. SQL stands for
                        “Structured Query Language.” Put simply, SQL is the language that we use to interact with a
                        database. SQL is the most widely-used database language as it’s incredibly effective at
                        manipulating data. My database can be seen as the third part of the client-server relationship.
                        Essentially, the client sends a request to the server, and the server grabs the associated data
                        from the database. Then the retrieved data is returned to the client by the server. In this
                        project I worked with PostgreSQL, or Postgres, a free, open-source object-relational database
                        management system. </p>
                      <p>In the project I preform two roles, data engineering and data analysis. An analyis employees
                        from
                        Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. The CSV data was inspected and an entity-relationship
                        model was sketched out using Quick Database Diagrams. As an engineering you have to create a
                        database from six CSV files. The project will design tables to hold data, import the data from
                        the
                        CSVs into a database, and answer the questions about the data. This project also adds complexity
                        by importing the SQL database into Pandas instead of reading the CSV files directly. A histogram
                        vizulation was created of the most common salary ranges for employees and a bar chart of salary
                        by
                        title is provided.</p>
                      <p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
                      <p>After creating the database, list the following: List the following details of each employee:
                        employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary. List first name, last name, and hire
                        date
                        for employees who were hired in 1986. List the manager of each department with the following
                        information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first
                        name. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last
                        name, first name, and department name. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose
                        first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B." List all employees in the Sales
                        department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name. List
                        all
                        employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name,
                        first name, and department name. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last
                        names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

                      <p>In this project I’ll be demonstrating my advanced SQL skills with a new toolkit to store and
                        retrieve datasets. SQLite is a dialect for using an SQL database. The syntax is very similar to
                        the PostgreSQL syntax, with the main difference between the two being that SQLite is entirely
                        serverless. SQLite allows for the power of database storage but with a tiny footprint. SQLite is
                        also conveniently part of the standard Python library, so no additional setup is needed to get
                        it
                        up and running. SQLite is not comparable with PostgreSQL or any other SQL language, rather it
                        focuses on providing local data storage for individual applications. What does ORM mean? ORM
                        stands for Object-Relational Mapper. Object-relational mapping allows me to write SQL queries
                        using the object-oriented paradigm of the language. In other words, for our purposes in class,
                        it
                        allows us to interact with our database using Python. Python is an "Object-Oriented Programming
                        (OOP) language", which means that it is highly concerned with organization and reusability.
                        Classes are crucial to OOP in that they allow us to group related things and keep them together.
                        A
                        class is essentially a template that allows us to create objects, which have variables and
                        behaviors associated with them. It helps streamline my code and create efficiencies whenever
                        something needs to be used various times.</p>
                      <p>Science based pharmaceutical company named Pymaceuticals Inc. out of San Diego, CA.
                        Pymaceuticals
                        specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for
                        potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin
                        cancer.
                      </p>
                      <p>In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug
                        regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose
                        of
                        this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus
                        the other treatment regimens. All tables and figures needed for the techical study provided.</p>
                      <p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
                      <p>Remove any duplicates (mouse ID), generage summary statistics table consisting of the mean,
                        median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
                        Generatea
                        bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of
                        total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study. Generate a pie
                        plotusing
                        both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or
                        male mice in the study.Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most
                        promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the
                        quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all
                        four
                        treatment regimens. Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume
                        for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing
                        their
                        color and style. Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of
                        tumor
                        volume vs. time point for that mouse. Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average
                        tumor
                        volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear
                        regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot
                        the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot. Look across all previously
                        generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be
                        made
                        from the data. Observations included at the top of notebook.

                      <p>In this project I used the data I found on the web in my project using a concept called web
                        scraping,
                        as well as connecting to a new type of database, MongoDB. While SQL is an extremely powerful
                        language for defining and manipulating data, it can actually be restrictive. SQL requires you to
                        use predefined schemas to determine my data structure, and requires that all of my data follow
                        the
                        same structure. A NoSQL database like MongoDB has a dynamic schema for unstructured data and can
                        store data in a variety of ways. This gives it much more flexibility in practice as not all data
                        will come structured in the same way.</p>
                      <p>In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to
                        a
                        Mission to Mars and displayed the information in a single HTML page. The web application scraped
                        various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars using various web scraping techniques.
                        THen it stored the scraped data using MongoDB and I created a Flask template app that quered the
                        database to pass the Mars data into a single HTML page.

                        <p>The Mars News Site was craped to collect the latest news title and paragraph text. Splinter
                          was
                          used to pull a featured image from the JPL Mars Space site. Instead of saving an image, he
                          image
                          is imported by an assigned url string to a variable. Next using Pandas we scraped the Mars
                          Facts
                          website table that contained the facts about the planet. Then used Pandas to convert
                          the data to the HTML string. For the Mars Hemispheres, we pulled high resolution images for
                          each
                          of the Mar's hemispheres. Instead of saving image the image url string image was stored using
                          the keys img_url and title in a Python dictionary. MongoDB and Flask templating were used to
                          create the HTML page that displayed all the information that was scraped fom the URLs. The
                          Jupyter notebook was converted into a Python script called scrape_mars.py with a functhion
                          called scrape that will containing all of the scraped data. Then a route was created to import
                          the script and call the scrape function. The value that was returned was stored in Mongo as a
                          Python dictionary. A root route was created that will query the Mongo database and pass the
                          mars
                          data into an HTML template to display the data. A template HTML file was created that took the
                          mars data dictionary and displayed all the data in the appropriate HTML elements. </p>

                      <p>This project allowed me to combined my SQL skills, Pandas, Python, and more. The team and I
                        picked a top and used the ETL process to do an analysis.</p>
                      <p>The team selected the topic of topic of India and the impact of weather on food. India is one
                        of
                        the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage.
                        India has 15 major languages among 28 states. Each state has its own way of living including the
                        food they eat, meat consumption, Different flavors and recipes which refine the palate for most
                        of
                        us. Food consumption also depends on the weather in the state.
                      </p>
                      <p>Using the ETL process, we analyzed the data to see if we could answer the following questions,
                        "Which part of India consumes more meat or dairy?" And "What kind of flavors do the dry land
                        states like the most?</p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
                      <p>In order to load the data, SQLAlchemy was used to create an engine to connect to complete,
                        joined
                        the Indian food and state rainfall information using SQL on state code column. Refer to
                        Merging_Datasets_query.sql in the repository. Next we Updated the data that did not have some
                        values from ‘-1’ to ‘Not Available’. Once the final table is merged and loaded, used SQL queries
                        to analyze the data and come up with interesting facts. As part of the analysis process, split
                        the
                        ingredients column into a separate table to query further and perform detailed analysis.

                        geography in the data is highly relevant. For example, a marketing stakeholder would be
                        interested
                        to know the popularity of their product in specific states to understand how to best move

                      <p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about

                      <p>The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their
                        earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but
                        they
                        lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data
                        will
                        allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure

                      <p>A dataset was used from USGS using GeoJson Feed and API. A map was created using Leaflet that
                        plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longtitude and latitude. The
                        data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake
                        by
                        color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with

                        a sketch ideal visual, then worked together to gather a dataset, build a database, clean the
                        dataset, analysis the data, develop a website and publish it to Heroku.</p>
                      <p>About this project: As frequent flyers, our team was interested in exploring in-flight
                        emergency
                        air situations using squawk 7700 codes. We created an interactive web dashboard using Heroku to
                        explore over 4.2 million rows of data from OpenSky which we loaded into PostgreSQL. Data is
                        derived from the OpenSky dataset in order to illustrate in-flight emergency situations
                        triggering
                        the 7700 transponder code. Data spans flights seen by the network's more than 2500 members
                        between
                        1 January 2018 and 29 January 2020. Multiple charts update from data that is stored in
                        PostgreSQL.
                        The project is powered by a Python Flask API and Heroku. Airlines can use this data to highlight
                        safety issues they need to address and compare aircraft performance. Customers can this data to
                        learn about frequent flight emergencies and select airlines or aircraft types with fewer
                        emergencies.

                      <p>This project expanded my visualization skillset. What are some of the advantages to Tableau?
                        While Excel and VBA allow you to be very flexible in how you manipulate your data, Tableau
                        allows you to more easily discover and share visualizations, even ones that aren’t readily
                        available in Excel (like world maps). Tableau also allows for high flexibility in changing data
                        sources, changing the kind of chart you want to use, and adding data/changing scenarios on the
                        fly without much overhead. The drag-and-drop abilities of Tableau make it incredibly simple to
                        integrate more data. Different tools for different uses makes it easier for you to adapt and
                        adjust, giving your stakeholders what they want.

                      <p>In this project I will ask as the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program. I'll
                        overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. I've generated some reports
                        for
                        city officials to use in their decisions to publicize and improve the city program. The dataset
                        was harvested by the Citi Bike Program robust infrastructure which was implemented for data
                        collection on the program's utilization. Each month bike data is collected, organized, and made
                        public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. However, while the data has been regularly updated, the
                        team
                        has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a
                        number
                        of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to

                        backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.
                        I used this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans.
                        Specifically, I compared the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
